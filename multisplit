It is often necessary to split a string into pieces based on several different (potentially multi-character) separator strings, while still retaining the information about which separators were present in the input.

This is particularly useful when doing small parsing tasks. 
The task is to write code to demonstrate this.

The function (or procedure or method, as appropriate) should take an input string and an ordered collection of separators.
